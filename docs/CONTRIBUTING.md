# Contributing

Please note the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which all contributors are expected to follow.

## Ideas / Issues / Pull Requests
Since everyone's time is valuable, the policy is simple: **try not to create a duplicate**.
Just do a quick search before you open a new issue.

As a reminder: if you are putting lots of hours into a pull request, 1) thank you, and 2) **mention it somewhere**.
It would suck to spend lots of time making something and have someone beat you to it.
